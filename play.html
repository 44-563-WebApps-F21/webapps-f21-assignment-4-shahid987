                        <b>LADY WINDERMERE.</b>  Don’t talk about such people.

                        LORD DARLINGTON.  Well then, setting aside mercenary people, who, of
                        course, are dreadful, do you think seriously that women who have
                        committed what the world calls a fault should never be forgiven?

                        LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Standing at table_.]  I think they should never be
                        forgiven.

                        LORD DARLINGTON.  And men?  Do you think that there should be the same
                        laws for men as there are for women?

                        LADY WINDERMERE.  Certainly!

                        LORD DARLINGTON.  I think life too complex a thing to be settled by these
                        hard and fast rules.

                        LADY WINDERMERE.  If we had ‘these hard and fast rules,’ we should find
                        life much more simple.

                        LORD DARLINGTON.  You allow of no exceptions?

                        LADY WINDERMERE.  None!

                        LORD DARLINGTON.  Ah, what a fascinating Puritan you are, Lady
                        Windermere!

                        LADY WINDERMERE.  The adjective was unnecessary, Lord Darlington.

                        LORD DARLINGTON.  I couldn’t help it.  I can resist everything except
                        temptation.

                        LADY WINDERMERE.  You have the modern affectation of weakness.

                        LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Looking at her_.]  It’s only an affectation, Lady
                        Windermere.
